## Summary
>The Enron scandal, revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world.

>The Enron Corpus is a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation, my job was to identify the people involved in the fraud from the data set.

>Using Machine Learning (Python's sklearn package) I got an recall score of 50% and a precision of 40%. This means that out of every 100 fraud persons present in the data set my algorithm would detect 50(50% recall score) of them correctly. Also, out of every 100 person it labels a fraud only 40 (40% precision )of them would actually be a fraud.
